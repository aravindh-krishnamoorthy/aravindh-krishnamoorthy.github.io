\justifying \noindent Aravindh Krishnamoorthy received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) degrees from the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany, in 2015 and 2024, respectively, and B.E. from Visvesvaraya Technological University, India, in 2003. From 2003 to 2024, he was employed at Philips and NXP Semiconductors, Ericsson, Fraunhofer IIS, and FAU. Since 2025, he is at the LiFi Research and Development Centre, University of Cambridge, UK.	
	
Aravindh's industrial experience spans system and algorithm design for 2/4/5G communication systems, standardization, numerical and matrix analysis, digital signal processing, and embedded (vector) programming. His research areas include system and algorithm design for radio frequency and optical systems, linear algebra, and information and communication theories. Aravindh is an author of several patents and IEEE journal articles. He is also an open source programmer and an open research proponent.
	
Aravindh's doctorate was sponsored by the Fraunhofer foundation via Fraunhofer IIS.
